# the latest cutest.
'Founded in 1865, Carter’s has dressed generations of children. Today, Carter’s is the number one children’s brand, selling more than 10 products for every child born in the United States. Our trusted partnership with Carter’s began with a single sock line nearly 25 years ago. Over time, our relationship has grown to encompass designing, developing, manufacturing, distributing and marketing seasonal, international collections for travel accessories, socks, hosiery, shoes, hair fashions, jewelry and sunglasses for Carter’s and all their brands which include OshKosh b'Gosh, Child of Mine and Just One You.



 Today, we create and develop over 14 product categories for Carter’s per year and the partnership continues to grow.
